# ACEMS R Project Ideas
Welcome to the project for ACEMS Members to discuss, collaborate and post ideas for R projects. 

## Posting Ideas
Please post any ideas to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/r_project_ideas/issues) Page above or comment on ideas you are interested in. These ideas can relate to ACEMS in some way, either visualisation, metrics or making the Centre more efficient. However, they can also be about any Open Science R package/tool you would like to find collaborators to work with you on. 

## ACEMS Data
There are three datasets that we aim to make available for visualising and exploring ACEMS data: 

1. ACEMS members, ORCID ID, Google scholar IDS
2. R packages authored, or contributed to, by ACEMS members
3. Publication DOIs, authors, publication date.

## Connect with other R Users within ACEMS
You can also get invovled in ACEMS R community on the ACEMS Slack channel. If you are not on the slack channel please contact the ACEMS stakeholder Engagement officer [Jessie Roberts](https://acems.org.au/our-people/jessie-roberts).
